    "## Instantiate the data object\n",
    "As a first step, the Objectiv Frame object is instantiated. The Objectiv Frame is an extension to Bach DataFrame to use specifically for data that was collected with Objectiv’s Tracker. Bach is Objectiv’s data modeling library. With Bach, you can use familiar Pandas-like DataFrame operations in your notebook. It uses a SQL abstraction layer that enables models to run on the full dataset, and you can output models to SQL with a single command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Objectiv Bach api is heavily inspired by the pandas api. We believe this provides a great, generic interface to handle large amounts of data in a python environment while supporting multiple data stores. For more details on Objectiv Bach, visit the docs.\n",

The `time_aggregation` parameter determines the standard timeframe that is used with aggregation functions from the model hub. Ie. 'YYYY-MM-DD' means that days are used for the time aggregation. Only data starting at `start_date` is used for all following operations."
