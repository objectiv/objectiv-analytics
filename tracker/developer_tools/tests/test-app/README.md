# Test app for developer-tools

This project has been created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It's a very basic TypeScript React application stripped down of all non-essentials.

It's composed of an index bootstrapping React and an App component. The latter has several buttons triggering exceptions.
