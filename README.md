Objectiv is an open-source product analytics pipeline for reusable modeling.

With Objectiv, you can take, stack and run [pre-built data models](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/open-model-hub) off the shelf to quickly build highly specific model stacks for in-depth product analytics and exploration. Objectiv's reusable modeling is enabled by validating all collected data against an [open analytics taxonomy](https://www.objectiv.io/docs//taxonomy) to ensure it is clean, consistent and structured with effective modeling in mind.

With the included [Objectiv Bach](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/modeling) modeling library, you can customize or build models with familiar Pandas-like dataframe operations that run on your full SQL dataset. When you're ready to share your findings, you can output to open-source BI tools with a single command.
