Objectiv is a data collection & modeling library that puts the data scientist first. 

It proposes the adoption of [a common taxonomy for analytics](https://www.objectiv.io/taxonomy), enabling a shared way to collect well-structured, pre-validated data that is ready to model on without significant gruntwork. Models & datasets embracing the taxonomy are reusable and interchangeable, allowing data scientists to build on knowledge and practices of others.

With [Objectiv Bach](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/modeling/) (our data modeling library), you can use familiar Pandas-like DataFrame operations on your full SQL dataset. It includes extensions for effective feature creation for datasets that embrace [the open taxonomy of analytics](https://objectiv.io/docs/taxonomy).
