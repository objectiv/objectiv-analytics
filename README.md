Objectiv is a data collection & modeling library that puts the data scientist first. It is built around 
[the open taxonomy of analytics](https://objectiv.io/docs/taxonomy), which is our proposal for a common way to collect, 
structure and validate data. With Objectiv, you create a 
[contextual layer for your application](https://objectiv.io/docs/tracking/core-concepts/tagging) by mapping it to the taxonomy, 
with the goal of collecting better data and more effective modeling.

With [Objectiv Bach](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/modeling/) (our data modeling library), you can use familiar Pandas-like DataFrame operations on your full SQL dataset. It includes extensions for effective feature creation for datasets that embrace [the open taxonomy of analytics](https://objectiv.io/docs/taxonomy).
