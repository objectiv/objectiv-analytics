### Fixtures
There is some pytest 'magic' here that automatically fills out the 'engine' and 'dialect' parameters for
test functions that have either of those.
By default such a test function will get a Postgres dialect or engine. But if --big-query or --all is
specified on the commandline, then it will (also) get a BigQuery dialect or engine. For specific
tests, it is possible to disable postgres or bigquery testing, see 'marks' section below.

Additionally we define a 'pg_engine' fixture here that always return a Postgres engine. This fixture should
not be used for new functions tho! After fully implementing BigQuery it will be removed.

### Marks and Test Categorization
A lot of functionality needs to be tested for multiple databases. The 'engine' and 'dialects' fixtures
mentioned above help with that. Additionally we have some marks (`@pytest.mark.<type>`) to make it explicit
which databases we expect tests to run against.

We broadly want 5 categories of tests:
* unit-test: These don't interact with a database
  * unit-tests that are tested with multiple database dialects (1)
  * unit-tests that are database-dialect independent (2)
* functional-tests: These interact with a database
  *  functional-tests that run against all supported databases (3)
  *  functional-tests that run against all supported databases except Postgres (4)
  *  functional-tests that run against all supported databases except BigQuery (5)

1 and 3 are the default for tests. These either get 'engine' or 'dialect' as fixture and run against all
databases. Category 2 are tests that test generic code that is not geared to a specific database.
Category 4 and 5 are for functionality that we explicitly not support on some databases.

Category 2, 4, and 5 are the exception, these need to be marked with the `db_independent`, `skip_postgres`,
or `skip_bigquery` marks.

### Other
For all unittests we add a timeout of 1 second. If they take longer they will be stopped and considered
failed.

The fixture `unique_table_test_name` gives out a unique table name to each test that use it. These tables are
automatically deleted at the end of the test session.
