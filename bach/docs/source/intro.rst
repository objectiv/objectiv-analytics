Data collected with Objectivâ€™s Tracker and stored in an SQL database can be analyzed
in a Jupyter notebook with the open model
hub. The open model hub is a growing collection of open-source, free to use data models that you can take,
combine and run for product analysis and exploration. It includes models for a wide range of typical product
analytics use cases.

See the :ref:`example notebooks <example_notebooks>` section to get started immediately. View the list of
available models :ref:`here <models>` or check out the full
:ref:`open model hub api reference <modelhub_api_reference>`.

The open model hub is powered by Bach: Objectiv's data modeling library. With Bach, you can compose models with
familiar Pandas-like dataframe operations in your notebook. It uses a SQL abstraction layer that enables
models to run on the full dataset, and you can output models to SQL with a single command. Head over to the
:ref:`Bach <bach>` section to learn all about it.
